Bangkok's Suwanapum Airport, one of Asia's busiest and these customs officers are on the lookout.
Every day they get tip-offs, but it's nearly always young travellers with large new suitcases that they stop.
When they're opened, more often than not the customs officers find vacuum sealed packages of marijuana,
grown in Thailand but destined for the UK.
Now, one of several rooms where Thai customs keep suitcases that they've confiscated from mainly British travellers.
We've been told there are around 200 here, all filled with marijuana.
That's probably around 3 tonnes taken in just the past month.
But these days, there are so few regulations governing the production and distribution of marijuana in Thailand
that those trying to take these cases out of the country face either very light penalties or no punishment at all.
It's a different story though when they leave Thailand.
Last month, two British women were detained in Sri Lanka and Georgia, accused of carrying large amounts of Thai cannabis.
Hundreds more have been arrested in Britain over the past year, after coming back from Thailand with marijuana in their luggage.
They now face years in prison.
Some of these curriers are exploited, some of them are vulnerable,
and they're not considering the life-changing consequences for something they think is a low-risk issue.
Do you think the curriers don't understand this? How serious it is if they get caught?
I don't think that they appreciate the risk until it's too late.
Thailand's decision three years ago to decriminalise marijuana set off an uncontrolled boom with dispensaries popping up on every street corner.
Prices collapsed, and the smuggling syndicates moved in.
Now the Thai government has decided to act.
Last month, the health minister promised that soon, using marijuana,
will require a medical certificate with more regulations to come.
But just how easy is it to buy large quantities of marijuana here?
I decided to find out that this gathering of local growers who have been protesting against the proposed new regulations.
Can boy, if I wanted to buy 46 kilos of marijuana, could I just come to your farm and you just apply it to me?
No.
It turns out it's not easy.
This grower showed me the license he needs to sell his crop, and then only to license shops.
He can't sell directly to British bank packers.
What's needed, say those who've campaigned for decriminalisation, is not more regulations,
but action against the many unlicensed growers who flooded the Thai market with cheap marijuana.
If they just follow their own existing rules and enforce those rules,
we would probably mitigate a lot of the issue that they have right now,
which is the smuggling going outside, and then also in terms of licensing,
I'll say without the license.
So is this the end of Thailand's freewheeling weed experiment?
No one really knows yet.
But what is clear is the original dream of a new industry of idealistic local cultivators has turned sour.
And now with pressure from countries like Britain, the government wants to rein it in.
